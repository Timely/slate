Timely uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed due to the information provided.
Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Timely's servers.

Unauthorized access o projects and accounts, or trying to create or delete objects that are not under our control, will result in errors.


The Timely API uses the following error codes:
